          <p>
            Welcome to the Period Counting Education program, designed to
            empower individuals with knowledge about menstrual cycles.
            Understanding your menstrual cycle is a fundamental aspect of
            reproductive health. Let's delve into the key aspects of period
            counting:
          </p>

          <div class="img-period-counting">
            <img

          Menstruating can be uncomfortable for some people, and not for others.
          lt is common to have cramps in the abdomen, feel bloated and have pain
          in the thighs and back. Some people also have headaches, constipation,
          nausea or dizziness. Others may feel tense, angry or emotional before
          and during their period. lt is also normal to have less energy, tender
          breasts and acne. But there are some girls and women who don’t have
          any of these symptoms at all. That is normal as well. Myths and facts
          about menstruation9 Women cannot have sex during menstruation. False.
          There is no reason why a woman should avoid sex during her period.
          This is her choice. Menstruating women and girls cannot bath or take a
          shower. False. There is no reason to avoid contact with water during
          your period - in fact, hygiene is very important at this time. If a
          woman has sex during menstruation, she can’t get pregnant. False. The
          chances of getting pregnant during menstruation are low. However, it
          is still possible to get pregnant if you have sex without
          contraception, given that every woman’s ovulation cycle is different.
          Menstruation is dirty or dangerous. False. Menstrual blood is composed
          of regular blood and tissue, with no special or dangerous properties;
          so mensturating people do not need to be isolated or stigmatized. If a
          menstruating woman or girl touches the food or enters the kitchen,
          this will cause the food to go bad. False. There is no scientific
          proof at all that menstruation causes food to go bad. A woman/girl
          that has not had vaginal sex cannot use a tampon. False. Because of
          its small size, the use of a tampon does not pose any risk to
          women/girls who have not had vaginal sex. Girls can have a normal
          daily life while they are menstruating.

        <h2>FAMILY PLANNING</h2>

        <label>
          Family planning is a comprehensive approach empowering individuals and
          couples to make informed decisions about the timing and number of
          children. Key points include:

          <p>
            <b>1. Empowerment:</b> Family planning enables individuals to choose
            when and how many children to have, aligning with their personal
            circumstances and aspirations.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>2. Contraception Methods:</b> Various methods, such as hormonal,
            barrier, intrauterine devices, and permanent options, offer
            flexibility for individuals to choose the most suitable form of
            contraception.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>3. Education and Counseling:</b> Family planning emphasizes
            education and counseling, ensuring individuals have accurate
            information about reproductive health, contraceptive options, and
            available services.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>4. Maternal and Child Health:</b> Spacing pregnancies through
            family planning positively impacts maternal and child health,
            reducing risks associated with closely spaced births.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>5. Preventing Unintended Pregnancies:</b> Family planning aims to
            prevent unintended pregnancies by providing access to contraception
            and education, leading to better outcomes for families and
            individuals.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>6. Respecting Reproductive Rights:</b> Rooted in the principles
            of respecting reproductive rights, family planning advocates for the
            elimination of coercion and discrimination in reproductive
            healthcare.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>7. Global Impact:</b> Family planning initiatives have a global
            impact on population growth, maternal and child health, and economic
            development, contributing to sustainable development goals.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>8. Inclusive Approach:</b> Family planning programs adopt an
            inclusive and client-centered approach, recognizing diverse needs,
            cultures, and preferences to ensure accessible and tailored
            services.
          </p>

          In conclusion, family planning is a fundamental component of
          reproductive health that promotes individual autonomy, healthier
          societies, and sustainable development through informed
          decision-making about fertility and family size.

        <h2>
          Kids Corner : <small>Sexual and Reproductive health basics</small>
        </h2>
        The Kids Corner program is specifically designed to educate and
        enlighten parents and children aged 5 to 10 on crucial aspects of child
        safety and well-being. Within this initiative, one vital area of focus
        is helping children understand the difference between good and bad
        secrets. By providing guidance on discerning harmless secrets from those
        that may be harmful, the program fosters an environment of trust and
        open communication within families, empowering children to speak up
        about any concerning situations they encounter. A core aspect of the
        Kids Corner program involves educating children about their genital
        anatomy in an age-appropriate manner. Through comprehensive learning,
        children gain knowledge about the names and functions of their genital
        parts, promoting a positive body image and equipping them to identify
        and report any inappropriate behavior related to their bodies. Parents
        are also provided with resources to facilitate effective communication
        with their children about these sensitive topics, creating a supportive
        environment for learning and understanding. Additionally, the Kids
        Corner program emphasizes the importance of the underwear rule, which
        teaches children about boundaries and personal space. By establishing
        clear guidelines regarding who is allowed to see or touch their private
        areas, children learn to assert their boundaries and recognize when they
        feel uncomfortable or unsafe. Furthermore, the program educates children
        on the significance of genital hygiene, teaching them how to properly
        care for their bodies and maintain their overall health. Through these
        teachings, children develop a sense of autonomy and self-confidence,
        empowering them to advocate for their own well-being and safety within
        the Kids Corner community.
